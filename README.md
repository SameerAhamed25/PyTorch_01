> Why use ML or Deep Learning??!
> 

We can use ML and Deep learning for finding patterns, associations ,rules, solutions ect for complex problems by providing inputs or outputs to the program making it figure out the rules.

it is used for problems which need continuously changing environments and discovering insights within large collection of data .

> “If you can build a simple rule-based system that dosen’t require ml, do that.!”
> 

types of learning:

- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Transfer Learning
- reinforcement learning

> What is Pytorch ??
> 

most popular deep learning framework for writing ML algos.

> What is tensor??

It is data structure that is very similar to arrays and matrices, used to encode the inputs and outputs of a model.
